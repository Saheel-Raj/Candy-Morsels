## Project Report: Candy Morsels
 Introduction: 
 //
 This project is a simple web-based game called Candy Morsels, inspired by the famous Candy
 Crush. It is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to match three or
 more candies of the same color in a row or column to score points within a given time limit.
 //
## Features of the Game
 • Interactive grid-based game board (8x8).
 • Different colored candies represented by images.
 • Ability to swap adjacent candies.
 • Detection and elimination of matches (3 in a row/column).
 • Score tracking based on matches.
 • Animated candy popping effect.
 • Timer of 60 seconds to complete the game.
 • Restart button to reload the game.
 
 ##Working of the Game
 The game initializes by generating an 8x8 grid of random candies. Players can select a candy and
 swap it with an adjacent one. If the swap results in three or more candies of the same color in a row
 or column, they disappear, and new candies fall into place. The player earns points for each match,
 and the game continues until the timer runs out. At the end of the game, the score is displayed.
 Technologies Used
 • HTML: Structure of the game page.
 • CSS: Styling, layout, and animations.
 • JavaScript: Game logic, interactions, and timer.
 Conclusion:
 The Candy Morsels project demonstrates the use of front-end technologies to create an interactive
 game. It is a simplified version of Candy Crush and helps in understanding grid-based game logic,
 event handling, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
